                    <p style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br />Non-conventional renewal source of energy is the ultimate answer for the future. Bannari Amman group is having 31 nos of Wind Turbines generating 15 MW in high wind areas like Gudimangalam, Authukinathupatti, Midapadi etc near Coimbatore and Muppandal, Karunkulam, Radhapuram, Irukkandurai near Nagercoil in Tamilnadu State. Wind Turbines of world renowned suppliers such as Enercon from Germany, NEPC, Suzlon etc. have been installed in the above locations.The power generated from the wind energy generators is fed to the Tamilnadu State Electricity Board&#39;s Grid and adjusted in the power consumption of various industries, established by the group. The Total Capacity of Wind Turbine in the Group is 15 MW at present.<br /><br /></p>

                    <p style="font-family: sans-serif;" ><br />Sugar Industries are self sufficient in their requirement of electric power, water, steam, fuel, etc., and does not make use of other conventional sources of fuels. <br> <br> By producing steam at high pressures and using more efficient turbines, sugar plants can produce electricity in excess of their own requirements. The world over, co-generation has been recognised as a reliable way of generation of electricity.  Considering the thrust given by the Government of India, realising the potential available for Co-generation plants and their contribution, Bannari Amman Sugars Limited, in their sugar  <br><br>unit near Nanjangud of Mysore District, Karnataka State, has installed a Co-generation plant with a turbo generator of 16 MW capacity, and is exporting surplus 13 MW power to the Karnataka State Electricity Board&#39;s Grid. The power generation capacity has been enhanced to 36 MW now.Also has established a 20 MW Co-generation Plant in their Sugar Unit - I near Sathyamangalam, Erode District, Tamilnadu State.The New Co-generation Plant with 20 MW capacity at our sugar Unit - III near Kollegal ,Samrajnagar District Karnataka State, has has started its power generation from August 2014. <br><br> The Co-generation Plant with 28.8 MW capacity at the Sugar Unit - IV near Thiruvannamalai, Tamilanadu State, has started its power generation from January 2010.The Co-generation Plant with 25 MW capacity at our sugar Unit - V near Vengur Village, Villuppuram District, Tamilanadu State.The Total Capacity of Co-generation of Power in Bannari Group is 129.8 MW now .<br /><br /></p>
